* zlib: block-based -> stream-based (compress() > deflate(), uncompress() > inflate())
* rm tsc record ~
* support reads with negative position offset?
* pthreads for sub-block codecs
* which block size?
* fix alpha / which alpha?
* which window size?
* use zopfli compression instead of zlib compression (should be 3-8% smaller, but 2-3 orders of magnitude slower)?
* use brotli (.br) compression?
* website for tsc?
* upload repo to GitHub?
* license?
* trigger new block w/ each new rname
* update LUT (tsc -i): should display block-wise rnames, too
* tsc-1.5: this should be the SNP version (SNPs are stored in OPT (MD tag)
* print block-wise mapq statistics (should correlate with CR)
